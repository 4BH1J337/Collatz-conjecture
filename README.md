# Collatz Conjecture
The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) or hailstone sequence is presented here in an **interactive** computer programme to calculate the sequence.</br> 
The sequence is generated by starting with any **positive whole number** greater than zero and by following two **rules.**
1. If the number is odd, then multiply by three and add one ( x3+1)
2. If the number is even, then divide by two (/2)

The sequence will continue till *infinity* due to its nature, however the programme detects the lowest number in the series which is *1* and stops, then it shows some values like no. of **iterations** and a plotted **graph** of the generated sequence, then ask user whether to continue the sequence or not.</br>

**Prerequisites:**
* Your computer must be running Python3.9 or newer.

### Dependencies
* Below is the library that has been used. You must need to install, before executing the programme
```
pip install matplotlib

```

### Demo ⏯️

```

Pick a number & Press enter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9... >>>  7


7  Good choise

Press Enter to begin !

-> 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Iterations :  16

```

 We are in the loop, and the lowest number in one. Every positive integer, if you apply these rules,
 will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop.</br>
 and the number you get are called **hailstone numbers**, beacuse they go up and down like hailstones

 ` Press Enter to See the loop & Plotted graph`

### Looping ➰
```
Close the graph window first !

loop begins !

->  4 2 1

Iterations: 19

Press Enter to See the loop & Plotted graph

```

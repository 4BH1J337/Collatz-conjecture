 Pick a number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  : 7


7  Good choise


 Now we are going to apply two rules
 1. if the number is odd, we multiply by three and add one [ x3+1 ]
 2. if the number is even, we divide by two [ /2 ]


 Now we keep applying these two rules.

 We are in the loop, and the lowest number in one. Every positive integer, if you apply these rules,
 will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop. Commonly called Collatz conjecture or 3N+1
 and the number you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, beacuse they go up and down like hailstones
